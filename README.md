# Simple-C-Programs
Here is a list of some the past C programs I have written:

### File Sorter:
The program implements the Heapsort algorithm and File I/O operations in C to simulate the "sort" command in BASH to sort the records of a file.
The file contains customer data in the form of C struct points, where each record corresponds to a customer with a name and loyatly points.

### File Submission Network System
A large central server which can accept multiple clients and their files concurrently using network stream socket programming C. It uses concepts such as Forking, Exec, Piping and more.  

### Shell Piping
Simulates shell piping from BASH by taking n commands (with its arguments) in a array format and using concepts such as Forking, Redirection, Pipes and Exec to sequentially execute each command.
